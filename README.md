# Mobile-Sharing-App-Refactored

This is a refactored version of a capstone mobile sharing app project.
To provide a convenient development experience for developers working in the project, I refactored the code base into a Model-View-Controller design pattern.
This design pattern separates the data handling which is done by the model, the controller that dictates the functionality of program classes and methods, and the view on the client side.
